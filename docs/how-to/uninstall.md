# HOW TO UNINSTALL

We just need to ensure we don't have any container using the Docker Php7 composer image and then we can remove it.

##### Type in the shell:

```bash
sudo docker image rm <image-id>
```

Sorry to see you go :(

Please [give us feedback](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker-images/php7/composer/issues/new), so that we can improve.
