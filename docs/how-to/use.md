# HOW TO USE

Any developer with zero experience of Docker can take advantage of using Composer work-flow from a Docker Container.

Assuming that the [Install Intructions](install.md) have been followed, including the
[Bash Script Alias](install.md#bash-script-alias) creation, we can now use composer as normally we are used to work with it.
