# CREATE A MERGE REQUEST

When opening your Merge Request ensure to do it against the branch for the correct Docker image version.

Merge requests must use one of the available templates and all topics marked as `required` must be filled.

All optional topics not used must maintain their title and have their body replaced by 'N/A'.
