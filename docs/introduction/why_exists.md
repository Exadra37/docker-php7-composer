# WHY EXISTS?

To solve the issues of using the official Docker Compose Image, that:

* always use the last Php version, but we must run composer with the same Php version we will use in production.
* causes permissions issues in the file system between Host and Container.

This is one more project created from the desire of having a Docker work-flow done in the right way, that can be used
between Production and Development without discrepancies and ambiguities, by other words with the main aim of achieve
100% parity between the environments.

This is part of a series of packages for the [Php7 Docker Stack](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker-compose/php7/docker-stack).
