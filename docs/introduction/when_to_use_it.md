# WHEN TO USE IT?

Every time we code any Php app or package we should do it based on a Docker work-flow, thus this Php7 Docker Image
will allows us to start and maintain our project by running Composer always from a Docker Container.

This is part of a series of packages for the [Php7 Docker Stack](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker-compose/php7/docker-stack).
