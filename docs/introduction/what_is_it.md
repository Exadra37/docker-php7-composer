# WHAT IS IT?

A package that will allow us to create Docker Images with Composer for each Php7 version, so that we can install our
dependencies with the same exact Php7 version used in Production.

This is part of a series of packages for the [Php7 Docker Stack](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker-compose/php7/docker-stack).
